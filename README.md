# 🚶‍♂️ Pedestrian Detection System for Autonomous Vehicles 🚗🤖

This project leverages the **YOLOv5** model for real-time pedestrian detection in video feeds, making it a valuable tool for autonomous vehicles or surveillance systems. YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. The system detects pedestrians in real-time, drawing bounding boxes around detected individuals in the video feed.

## 🧠 Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Detect pedestrians in real-time using YOLOv5.

- **Pre-Trained Model**: Utilizes the pre-trained YOLOv5 model on the COCO dataset.

- **High Accuracy**: YOLOv5 is fast and accurate, making it suitable for real-time applications.

- **Customization**: Can be adapted to different video inputs such as webcams or video files.
